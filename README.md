About: Commonwealth is a peer-to-peer algorithmic bank that mints P3C via a smart contract. When ETC is deposited or withdrawn from the contract a 10% dividend is paid proportionally and instantly to every holder. This micro-dividend is used to provide long term income stability to those without access to banks across the world. It is also used as a currency for online applications and to pay for things.
